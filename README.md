Backend Level Beyond homework assignment

* Tools and Implementation
  * Java 8
  * Spring-Boot
  * H2 in memory database
  * port 8088 for this implemenation


* Build and Run the application from the java-notes-api path
  * mvn clean package
  * java -jar target/notes-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar


* API
  * The base URL is http://localhost:8088/api/items
  * I implemented each of the API calls from the homework assignment.
  * I used an in memory db that needs to be populated each time prior to any queries

I used Postman to do the api calls and all the tests went well. If you have any issues please do let me know.
